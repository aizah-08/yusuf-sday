Hey love,
Happy Birthday!!!!
Ok its gonna be a long one… 
I can’t tell you how special you are to me. Baby you are perfect in every way possible except a few(hehe). You are my first in everything and I want you to be the last as well. Sounds really cringe but yess!! I want you to know I will always be there for u by your side always and forever<3.you feel like home to me. I love you for all the things u do for me. You have a really special place in my heart baby. I cant tell you how much u mean to me in words. All the moments I have spent with you is nothing but special. I promise you to spoil you as hell when I earn (abhi little poor hu) apke liye khana banana bhi seekh lungi who bhi high protein wala!!! Just so you know I find you sexy and hot af. Bohut gande thoughts hei apko leke (ache way mei pakka). I want to celebrate you everyday because you are special to me. 
I might not express it daily but YUSUF I LOVE YOU MORE THAN YOU KNOW!!!
